# Onboarding tasks

_Different tasks completed during self-learn time during onboarding._

## Course A 
### Module 2 
#### Lesson 1 - Docs team philosophy

##### But why?
Horizontal nav thoughts: 
1. The driver was to allow a user to pinpoint where they were within their journey using a horizontal nav design design.
2. Data was used to firstly set a target of reducing the volume of Google exits by 30%. However, based on the volumetric data of docs being across 30 products and 800 articles, it was idemtified that the content was too expansive to fit into this design. 
3. Principles: Design and strategy (user-centred and shipping to learn), content models.
